# Custom Statistical Power Analyses:
Ecological field data rarely follow standard distribution types. Adjustments should thus be made on the type of data distribution to be used when running statistical power analyses (e.g. to determine the appropriate sampling effort for monitoring programs). 

This repository regroups a number of functions – and a step by step procedure – to choose the most adequate data distribution type according to the results of, for instance, preliminary surveys (or pilot studies), and to adapt it to a statistical power analyses routine. 

## Distribution types:
So far, examples with the following distributions are given:
* Negative Binomial Distribution
* Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial Distribution
*  Poisson Distribution
*  Zero-Inflated Poisson 
*  Beta Distribution
*  Bi-modal distribution types

The workflow may, however, be adapted to any other distribution types to fit the particular needs of each study.
